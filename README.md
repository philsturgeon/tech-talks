Talks for conferences, meetups, corporate gigs, whatever.

I shoved my abstracts up here for easy access, this is what I copy 
and paste to conferences so maybe that can give some people some ideas.

Then my slides are in `content/` which I run with [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md), and export to `Ã¬nstances/` for specific events.

Happy to come and give any of these talks on a conference call if they've 
not been recorded and put online yet.
